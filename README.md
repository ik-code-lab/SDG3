Predicting Student Stress from Daily Habits
Project Overview

The aim is to predict student stress levels based on their daily activities and lifestyle habits.

By using real data, we want to discover how things like sleep, exercise, screen time, and academic pressure affect a student's mental well-being. This can help identify students who may need support â€” early and accurately.
